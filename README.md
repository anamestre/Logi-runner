Logi-runner is a mobile application that solves the problem of generating the musical experience of your running training. Every runner can select the time of the session, the intensity of running and the kind of training they want to do in order to automatically generate the music experience that better fits that runner. With this information, the application creates a music playlist that follows these constraints in order to achieve the best musical experience while training.
